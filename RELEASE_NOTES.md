# Changes in 1.2 (24 May 2024)

**Features and Improvements**:

- **NEW:** Feature allowing for **detection of changed profile pictures**; since Spotify user's profile picture URL seems to change from time to time, the tool detects changed profile picture by doing binary comparison of saved jpeg files; initially it saves the profile pic to *spotify_{user_uri_id}_profile_pic.jpeg* file after the tool is started (in monitoring mode); then during every check the new picture is fetched and the tool does binary comparison if it has changed or not; in case of changes the old profile picture is moved to *spotify_{user_uri_id}_profile_pic_old.jpeg* file and the new one is saved to *spotify_{user_uri_id}_profile_pic.jpeg* and also to file named *spotify_{user_uri_id}_profile_pic_YYmmdd_HHMM.jpeg* (so we can have history of all profile pictures); in order to control the feature there is a new **DETECT_CHANGED_PROFILE_PIC** variable set to True by default; the feature can be disabled by setting it to *False* or by enabling **-j** / **--do_not_detect_changed_profile_pic** parameter
- **NEW:** Feature attaching changed profile pics directly in email notifications (when **-p** parameter is used)
- **NEW:** Feature allowing to display the profile picture right in your terminal (if you have *imgcat* installed); put path to your *imgcat* binary in **IMGCAT_PATH** variable (or leave it empty to disable this functionality)
- **IMPROVE:** Improved detection of tracks changed for the playlist; previously if the number of added and removed tracks was the same it went unnoticed by the tool; currently the tool also compares last update timestamp of the playlist to cover such use cases
- **IMPROVE:** The tool now shows the time which passed since the previous time new track has been added to the playlist (console + email notifications)
- **NEW:** Possibility to define output log file name suffix (**-y** / **--log_file_suffix**)
- **IMPROVE:** Information about log file name visible in the start screen
- **IMPROVE:** Rewritten get_date_from_ts(), get_short_date_from_ts(), get_hour_min_from_ts() and get_range_of_dates_from_tss() functions to automatically detect if time object is timestamp or datetime
- **IMPROVE:** Detection of wrong Spotify user URI ID + unneeded while loop removed

**Bug fixes**:

- **BUGFIX:** Fixed stupid bug with the tool crashing when user had no public playlists at all
- **BUGFIX:** Fixed issues with sporadic broken links in HTML emails (vars with special characters are now escaped properly)

# Changes in 1.1 (19 May 2024)

**Features and Improvements**:

- **IMPROVE:** Improvements for running the code in Python under Windows
- **NEW:** Automatic detection of local timezone if you set LOCAL_TIMEZONE variable to 'Auto' (it is default now); requires tzlocal pip module

- **IMPROVE:** Strings have been converted to f-strings for better code visibility
